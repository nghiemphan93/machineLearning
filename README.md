diverse python and machine learning algorithm examples

### 05-09-2018
Target: 
* get used to the python syntax and libraries for machine learning

Done: 
* RenameFiles: walk through all files in a directory. 
    Remove the word "Manning." in the name of each file. 
    Set new name for each file without "Manning."
* TrafficLight: Simulate color sequence of a traffic light with Class and Enum

* Notice:

Target: 
* Learn the K Nearest Neighbor Algorithm and implement it

Problem:
* Given a set of data with label meaning which data belongs to which label
* Determine which label should be for a new random data 

Done: 
* Method classify(testData, dataSet, labels, k) and return a Tupel<label: maxVoteOfK>
* Given k => count the label of the k nearest points to the test point
* Probability of how exact the calculated result compared to the truth

Notice: 
* Took lots of time with new library stuff
* Code not worked because of different Python's version
* 2 types of Array in Python: normal and numPy's array (for direct matrix calculation)
